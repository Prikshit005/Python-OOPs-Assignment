        "- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of writing code that focuses on using \"objects\" to represent real-world things. Each object combines data (like a name or color) and actions (like running or jumping) into a single unit. These objects are created from templates called classes. OOP makes it easier to organize code, reuse parts of it, and build bigger programs more efficiently by using key ideas like inheritance (sharing features), encapsulation (hiding details), and polymorphism (doing the same thing in different ways)."

A class defines a set of attributes (also called properties or fields) and behaviors (methods or functions) that the objects created from the class will have. It encapsulates data and functions together in a single unit, promoting modularity and reusability. For example, a class called Car might include attributes like color, make, and year, and methods like drive() and brake(). When we create an object from the Car class, such as myCar, it inherits all the defined characteristics and functionalities. Classes help organize code logically and support the principles of OOP such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism."
